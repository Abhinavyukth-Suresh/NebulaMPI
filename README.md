# NebulaMPI
A Massively Parallel Message Passing Interface for Distributed Systems across a Network

## **Overview**<br />
NebulaMPI is a high-performance, scalable Message Passing Interface (MPI) library designed to parallelize computations across different systems in a network. This library enables distributed computing by allowing multiple systems to communicate efficiently, share tasks, and synchronize processes. Whether you're working on a small cluster or a large-scale grid of machines, NebulaMPI helps you leverage the full power of parallelism in a distributed environment.

## **Key Features** <br />
***Massive Parallelism:*** Leverages multiple machines for high-performance computing, enabling the parallel execution of tasks across a distributed system. <br /><br />
***Network Scalability:*** 
Optimized for performance across diverse networks, ensuring scalability as the number of systems in the network increases.<br /><br />
***Message Passing:***
Implements standard MPI semantics for inter-process communication (IPC), including point-to-point communication, collective operations, and synchronization.<br /><br />
***Cross-Platform:*** 
Compatible with various operating systems, including Linux and Windows<br /><br />
***Simple API:*** 
A user-friendly API to make parallel programming easier, with clear abstractions for communication and data sharing.
