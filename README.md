# NebulaMPI
A Massively Parallel Message Passing Interface for Distributed Systems across a Network

##Overview
MassiveMPI is a high-performance, scalable Message Passing Interface (MPI) library designed to parallelize computations across different systems in a network. This library enables distributed computing by allowing multiple systems to communicate efficiently, share tasks, and synchronize processes. Whether you're working on a small cluster or a large-scale grid of machines, MassiveMPI helps you leverage the full power of parallelism in a distributed environment.

##Key Features
###Massive Parallelism: 
Leverages multiple machines for high-performance computing, enabling the parallel execution of tasks across a distributed system.
###Network Scalability:
Optimized for performance across diverse networks, ensuring scalability as the number of systems in the network increases.
###Message Passing: 
Implements standard MPI semantics for inter-process communication (IPC), including point-to-point communication, collective operations, and synchronization.
###Cross-Platform:
Compatible with various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
Fault Tolerance: Designed with fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure reliability even in the case of network or system failures.
###Simple API:
A user-friendly API to make parallel programming easier, with clear abstractions for communication and data sharing.
